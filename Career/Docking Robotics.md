# Vision
- Scalable autonomous solutions
- Robotics to make a smarter and enhanced future

# Solution
- For **fleet managers** (responsible for company's vehicles)
	- Maximize fuel efficiency
	- Lower operational cost
- **Enhance deployment performance**:Transporting, Storing, Charging and Increasing their robotâ€™s reach, swarm capabilities, and tactical advantage
- *Main objective:* provide reliable docking solution for robotic systems fleets
	- Docking tech for robotics swarm
	- Uncontrolled environment

# Robot Carrier Vehicles
- Transport and support robotic systems
- Docking and charging
- Traverse difference terrain, avoid moving obstacle, capture data

# Proof of Concept: Carrier Vehicles
- *Challenge to overcome:* Limited reach: stationary charging & short battery life
- *Core features:*
	- Auto dock and on-the-go charging
	- Navigate various terrains
- *Teams:*
	- Engineering: durable and light weight chassis
	- Electrical: integrate sensors, motors, others
	- Software: navigate, dock with other robots, power distribution
- *Testing:*
	- Unideal conditions: low visibility, uneven ground
