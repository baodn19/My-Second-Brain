# Talked with [Barrett Werner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrett-werner-8b8429100/) over lunch
- Barrett is going to do a tour of Harvest CROO. A chance to recruit member
- List out some class that I want to sit in
- It's important to have the foundation -> I should consider doing dynamics or statics
- Have a good breadth while maintain a concentration
- Solving the hard problems doesn't mean you get paid well
- There are repetitive jobs that pay better
	- Eg: Barrett was paid more in his oil and gas company compared to the time in aerospace. However, the former job is easier and more repetitive
- Control exists everywhere, it's about the feedback loop
- It's impossible to learn everything, especially in robotics
- Carnegie and Rockefeller was rivals
