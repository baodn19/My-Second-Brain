# Review
- Write a summary

# Reading order
- Skim for structure, figures/ tables -> abstract -> conclusion: understand relevance
- Reference: find relevant papers

# Three pass method
- *Overview:*
	- 1st pass: general idea
	- 2nd pass: grasp content, not details
	- 3rd pass: in-depth understanding
## 1st pass: 
- *Duration:* 5-10 minutes
- *Steps:*
	1. Title, abstract, introduction
	2. Headings
	3. Conclusions
	4. In **Reference**, tick those already read
- *Questions to answer:* create a spreadsheet for this
	- *Category:* type of paper? (measurement paper, analysis of existing system, description or research prototype)
	- *Context:* related papers? theoretical bases
	- *Correctness:* valid assumption?
	- *Contribution:* main contributions
	- *Clarity:* well written?
- *As a writer:*
	- Expect others to do one pass: make others understand the gist in one pass
	- Choose coherent headings
	- Concise & Comprehensive abstracts

## 2nd pass
- *Action:* ignore proof, note key points
- *Duration:* 1 hour
- *Key takeaway:*
	- Summarize main thrust w/ supporting evidence to someone else
- *Steps:*
	1. Figures, diagrams, illustrations, graphs. Axes properly labeled? Results w/ error bars, so statistically significant?
	2. Mark relevant unread references

## 3rd pass
- *Action:* virtually re-implement: making the same assumptions & re-create work
	- Identify & challenge all assumption in every statement
	- How to present an idea
- *Duration:* 4-5 hours
- *Key takeaways:*
	- Reconstruct the structure of paper from memory
	- Identify strong and weak points
	- Pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations, and potential issues with techniques

# Literature Survey
1. Use academic search engine w/ keywords to find 3-5 **recent** papers in the area
2. First pass each; if lucky then find a survey paper
3. Find shared citations & repeated names in bibliography -> **Key papers**
4. Go to the **key researchers** for their publications -> Identify **top conferences**
5. Look at recent **proceedings** of top conference -> Look for quality works and do a 2nd pass
